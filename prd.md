**Technical Requirements Document (TRD)**

Project Name: Momentum — Blockers Tracker & Insights Platform

Version: 1.1

Prepared by: Product Manager (for Engineering Manager Team Productivity Project)

**1. Objective**

To build an internal productivity improvement tool (“Momentum”) that enables team members to log daily blockers, analyze productivity patterns, and allow managers to view team-wide insights. Each user can log in to view their blockers, trends, and AI-generated personal improvement suggestions. The app will leverage Contentstack CMS for structured data storage and Contentstack Launch for hosting and backend logic.

**2. Background**

Blockers that impact productivity are often discussed informally and not systematically tracked. This tool creates a transparent and data-driven mechanism to record, analyze, and resolve blockers using structured entries in Contentstack, Slack integration for ease of logging, and AI insights for action items.

**3. Goals**

*   Allow users to log blockers via Slack and also view their logs and insights on a Momentum Web App.
*   Enable manager dashboards for aggregated reports and team analytics.
*   Implement a Team Member content model to manage organization hierarchy and relationships.
*   Generate AI-driven insights for individuals and teams.

**4. Non-Goals**

*   Replace existing project management or HR systems.
*   Real-time blocker discussion or ticket assignment.

**5. System Overview**

Team members can log blockers via Slack using a command. The data flows into Contentstack as structured entries. Managers and individual users can log in to Momentum (hosted on Launch) to view dashboards. An AI module generates periodic reports highlighting recurring blockers and actionable recommendations.

**6. Content Models in Contentstack**

**6.1 Content Type: Team Member**

Fields: first\_name, last\_name, email, profile\_pic, profile\_pic\_url, designation, team, is\_manager, slack\_id.
Each Blocker references a Team Member entry.

**6.2 Content Type: Team**

Fields: title (team name), team\_id, description, manager (reference to team\_member), members (multiple reference to team\_member), status.
The Team content type is used to organize team members and **determine manager status** - if a user is set as the `manager` reference in any Team entry, they are granted manager privileges.

**6.3 Content Type: Blocker**

Fields: team\_member (reference), description, category, severity, timestamp, status, reported\_via, manager\_notes.

**6.4 Content Type: AI Report**

Fields: report\_type, target\_member (reference), report\_period, summary, action\_items, generated\_at.

**7. Functional Requirements**

**7.1 User Authentication & Access**

OAuth-based login via Slack or Google. System maps email/slack\_id to Team Member entry. 

**Manager Status Determination:** A user is considered a manager if they are set as the `manager` reference field in any Team entry. This is checked during login by querying all Team entries and checking if the user's UID matches any team's manager reference.

Access levels: Individual (own data), Manager (team data), Admin (all).

**7.1.1 Auto-Registration via Google OAuth**

When a user logs in via Google OAuth for the first time:
1. System checks if a Team Member entry exists with the user's email
2. If not found, automatically creates a new Team Member entry with:
   - `first_name`: From Google profile
   - `last_name`: From Google profile
   - `email`: From Google account (unique identifier)
   - `profile_pic_url`: Google profile picture URL (stored as text field for external URLs)
   - `designation`: "Other" (default, user can update later)
   - `is_manager`: false (default, admin can promote)
   - `status`: "Active"
3. User is then issued a JWT token for subsequent API requests
4. On subsequent logins, existing Team Member entry is retrieved and used

**Flow Diagram:**
```
Google OAuth Login
       ↓
  validateGoogleUser()
       ↓
  findByEmail(email)
       ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  User exists?   │
└─────────────────┘
    │         │
   YES       NO
    │         │
    ↓         ↓
 Return    Create new
 existing  team member
 user      in Contentstack
    │         │
    └────┬────┘
         ↓
  Generate JWT Token
         ↓
  Return AuthResponse
```

**7.2 Slack Integration**

Slash command `/blocker` opens a modal. Submissions create Blocker entries in Contentstack via Launch webhook.

**7.3 Momentum Web App (Launch Frontend)**

*   Personal Dashboard: Displays user's blockers, trends, and AI summaries.
*   Team Dashboard: Managers see team-level data, comparison charts, and AI insights.
*   **My Team (Manager Only):** Comprehensive team management view that shows:
    - All team members as interactive cards with blocker statistics
    - Click on any member to view their blockers and AI insights
    - Generate AI summary for individual team members
    - Generate AI summary for the entire team
    - Members sorted by urgency (high severity blockers first)

**7.4 AI Insight Generation**

Weekly serverless job analyzes blockers to create AI Reports for individuals and teams with suggested actions.

**8. User Roles & Permissions**

*   Individual User: View own blockers and AI reports.
*   Manager: View team-level blockers and reports.
*   Admin: Manage content and integration settings.

**9. Technical Architecture**

Slack Command → Launch Function → Contentstack Entry → Launch Dashboard → AI Function → AI Report Entry.

**10. API Integrations**

Slack API → Launch Webhook → Contentstack → Launch App → OpenAI API (via Launch Function).

**11. Security & Performance**

OAuth login, role-based access control, environment variable key storage, rate limiting for Slack submissions. Slack submissions <2s; dashboard <1s (cached).

**12. Success Metrics**

% of users logging blockers weekly >80%, average blocker resolution time reduced by 25%, AI recommendation accuracy >70%, satisfaction +20%.

**13. UX Wireframe Descriptions**

1.  Slack Modal: Input fields for description, category, severity.
2.  Personal Dashboard: Cards showing weekly blocker count, trend chart, AI summary.
3.  Manager Dashboard: Filters by team, category, member, and a summary panel with AI insights.
4.  AI Report Card: Displays AI-generated recommendations with timestamps.

**⚙️ End-to-End Flow: /blocker → Webhook → Contentstack Automation → Entry Creation**

**Overview**

You’ll use Slack + Contentstack Automations + Webhook integration to automatically create “Blocker” entries in your CMS, without needing a custom backend hosted elsewhere.

1.  A user enters the command `/blocker` in Slack.
2.  A Slack modal opens, prompting the user to provide blocker details such as description, category, and severity.
3.  When submitted, Slack sends a JSON payload to a Webhook trigger URL defined in Contentstack Automations.
4.  The automation recipe processes the payload and performs the following actions:
    *   Finds or creates a corresponding Team Member entry in the “team\_member” content type.
    *   Creates a new Blocker entry referencing that Team Member.
    *   Optionally sends a success confirmation message back to Slack.

**Slack Command Setup**

*   Command: `/blocker`
*   Request URL: Contentstack Automation Webhook URL
*   Description: “Log a work blocker”
*   Usage Hint: “/blocker <describe your blocker>”

**Automation Recipe Definition**

**Trigger:** Incoming Webhook
*   Triggered by Slack’s modal submission payload.

**Steps:**
1.  Find Team Member entry by Slack email or Slack user ID.
2.  If not found, create a new Team Member entry using Slack user details.
3.  Create a new Blocker entry using the following field mapping:
    *   Description → payload.submission.description
    *   Category → payload.submission.category
    *   Severity → payload.submission.severity
    *   Timestamp → payload.timestamp
    *   Reported\_via → “Slack”
    *   Team Member → Reference to the found/created team\_member entry
4.  (Optional) Send confirmation message back to Slack using response\_url.

**Security Considerations**

*   Restrict webhook to verified Slack requests using signing secrets.
*   Use Slack’s “X-Slack-Signature” header verification to ensure authenticity.
*   Store Slack tokens securely using environment variables in the Automation configuration.
